Description: Estimation and inference methods for the cross-quantilogram.
    The cross-quantilogram is a measure of nonlinear dependence between
    two variables, based on either unconditional or conditional quantile
    functions.  The cross-quantilogram can be considered as an extension
    of the correlogram, which is a correlation function over multiple lag
    periods and mainly focuses on linear dependency.  One can use the
    cross-quantilogram to detect the presence of directional
    predictability from one time series to another.  This package provides
    a statistical inference method based on the stationary bootstrap.  See
    Linton and Whang (2007) <doi:10.1016/j.jeconom.2007.01.004> for
    univariate time series analysis and Han, Linton, Oka and Whang (2016)
    <doi:10.1016/j.jeconom.2016.03.001> for multivariate time series
    analysis.
