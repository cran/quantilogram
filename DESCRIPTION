Description: Estimation and inference methods for the
    cross-quantilogram.  The cross-quantilogram is a measure of nonlinear
    dependence between two variables, based on either unconditional or
    conditional quantile functions.  The cross-quantilogram can be
    considered as an extension of the correlogram, which is a correlation
    function over multiple lag periods and mainly focuses on linear
    dependency.  One can use the cross-quantilogram to detect the presence
    of directional predictability from one time series to another.  This
    package provides a statistical inference method based on the
    stationary bootstrap.  See Linton and Whang (2007)
    <doi:10.1016/j.jeconom.2007.01.004> for univariate time series
    analysis and Han, Linton, Oka and Whang (2016)
    <doi:10.1016/j.jeconom.2016.03.001> for multivariate time series
    analysis.
